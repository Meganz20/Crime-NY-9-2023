1 - The population data for North Yorkshire was from 2020 comapared the more recent info for York and Ryedale.
2 - I am not even sure the police regions are the same as the regions where the popualtion was measured.
3 - It would be nice to have a look at more regions like Scarborough.
4 - It would be interesting to compare the rest of the counties and the whole uk too.
5 - This data is only for September 2023 so it would be interesting to monitor hwo crimes change over time. This would also increase the size of the dataset so the conclusions would be more concrete.
6 - It would be nice if the dataset had better time accuracy or a seperate time attatched to do with the outcome of the crime as I hope in the months after the crime the number of crimes under investigation goes down.
7 - It may be slightly controversial but comparing this to the number of people on benefits would be interesting.
